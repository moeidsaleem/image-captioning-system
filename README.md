# Image Captioning System

A final year project - Basically recognizing images and providing caption regarding that image.
This is based on PyTorch Neural Network.



## Languages

- JavaScript
- Python

## Technology

- Node.js
- Python (Python3)
- PyTorch (Neural Network)


## Machine Learning

We have used Pytorch Neural Network for this project along with Convoluional Neural Network with pretrained Resnet50. 
CNN-RNN Encoder Decoder were tarined with COCO datasets.

Using the COCOSET pretrained models, we are able to achieve captioning to great correction level.



## **Requirements for installation**

- Node JS
- Pytorch
- Numpy
- PIL.

## **Run**
To run the app you just need to install all dependencies and hit 'node server.js'
